# Plan

Host this under my AlexWilson.dev address.

So that means that I'll actually need to make a generic homepage of some sort.


### I'm going to call it #ProgrammerBodyWOD

It's going to be dead stupid.  I'll just make it super-fuckin-minimal.  Pull ups and sandbag workouts freely available with one shitty ad sitting off to the side.






## MVP Planning

- [x] Create a random name generator
- [x] Add at least 10 workouts to the JSON file
- [x] Randomly select a workout from the JSON file
- [x] Create a proper workout data structure
- [x] Create the basic vue components for the entire app
- [ ] Create WOD specific vue components
- [x] Create redis interface for adding to the workout list.
- [ ] Create a redis structure to hold the last 14 days workouts
- [ ] Add timestamp to the redis structure for the workout so it's known when it's added.
