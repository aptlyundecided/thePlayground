# Plan

Host this under my AlexWilson.dev address.

So that means that I'll actually need to make a generic homepage of some sort.


### I'm going to call it #ProgrammerBodyWOD

It's going to be dead stupid.  I'll just make it super-fuckin-minimal.  Pull ups and sandbag workouts freely available with one shitty ad sitting off to the side.
