# Bodyweight / Sandbags Workout Of The Day

During the Covid times, the demand for being able to workout without entering a gym has gone up.  I am going to write a quick little app which will randomly generate a workout name, and I'll take a crossfit workout, and modify it to where it only utilizes a workout sandbag, a pull-up bar, and a pair of running shoes.




### Minimum Things this app will need:
- Random name generator
- A workout data set (JSON file)
- REDIS cache (for heroku to track the last 14)
- The appropriate way of displaying these in VUE


I think I can build this whole app in 2 hours???  :thinking: Yeah, definitely no more than 3.


Especially because I don't have to come up with all the workouts right away!  I can basically just cruise the crossfit website, and morph them appropriately.
